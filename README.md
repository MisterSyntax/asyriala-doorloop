## Technology
This project is a typing test built with react, typescript, and MUI.

## Specifications 
This is a basic specification describing the main behavior. Anything not specified is up to you: UI structure and styling (no need for anything fancy), data to display, UX etc... Keep it simple.

Write a React UI that starts a 60 second game for a typing test. The test should show you words to type as fast as possible.
When starting, random words should line up for typing from the word bank below.
You should track character typing and typos as you see fit.
Pressing space should conclude a word and progress to the next word.
At the end of the game, show statistics such as the correct word count, number of mistakes, speed in Words Per Minute, and anything else you can think of.
